DuckDuckGo AI Chat can save up to 30 of your recent conversations so you can refer to them later. To protect your privacy, these chats are stored locally on your device, not on DuckDuckGo or model-provider servers. Recent chats can be disabled at any time in AI Chat settings.

Because recent chats are stored in your browser, their retention may vary based on the specific browser or app settings. For example, some browsers, such as Safari and the DuckDuckGo browser for MacOS and iOS, automatically delete recent chats if you go more than 7 days without visiting duckduckgo.com. If your browser allows you to adjust its data storage settings, we recommend reviewing those settings if you have specific preferences for conversation retention.
